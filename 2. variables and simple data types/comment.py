# Comments
''' comment allows you to write notes in English
within your programs. 
hash mark (#) indicates a comment. '''


# Say hello to everyone.
print("Hello Python people!")



# What Kind of Comments Should You Write?
''' The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is supposed
to do and how you are making it work. 
writing good comments can save you time by summarizing your 
overall approach in clear English.
Writing clear, concise comments in your code. '''


''' When you’re determining whether to write a comment, ask yourself if
you had to consider several approaches before coming up with a reasonable
way to make something work; if so, write a comment about your solution.
It’s much easier to delete extra comments later on than it is to go back
and write comments for a sparsely commented program. From now on, I’ll
use comments in examples throughout this book to help explain sections
of code. '''
