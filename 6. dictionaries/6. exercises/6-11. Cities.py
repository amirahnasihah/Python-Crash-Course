''' Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as
keys in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and
include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact
about that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something like
country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the information
you have stored about it. '''
