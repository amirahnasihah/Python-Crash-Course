# Chapter 10: Files and Exceptions

## Try It Yourself

**10-1. Learning Python:**

Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each line with the phrase _In Python you can. . . ._ Save the file as _learning_python.txt_ in the same directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote three times. Print the contents once by reading in the entire file, once by looping over the file object, and once by storing the lines in a list and then working with them outside the `with` block.
