# Web Applications 

In the Web Applications project (Chapters 18, 19, and 20), you’ll use the Django package to create a simple web application that allows users to keep a journal about any number of topics they’ve been learning about. Users will create an account with a username and password, enter a topic, and then make entries about what they’re learning. You’ll also learn how to deploy your app so anyone in the world can access it.

After completing this project, you’ll be able to start building your own simple web applications, and you’ll be ready to delve into more thorough resources on building applications with Django.

## Django
- Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

### Virtual environment?
- A virtual environment is simply a tool that separates the dependencies of different projects by creating a separate isolated environment for each project.
- These are simply the directories so that unlimited virtual environments can be created. This is one of the popular tools used by most of the Python developers.
