''' How the input() Function Works '''

# input() function pauses your program and waits for 
# the user to enter some text.

# input() function takes one argument: 
# prompt, or instructions, that we want to display to the 
# user so they know what to do

message = input("Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: ")
print(message)
