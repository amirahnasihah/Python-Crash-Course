''' How the input() Function Works '''

# input() function pauses your program and waits for 
# the user to enter some text.

# input() function takes one argument: 
# prompt, or instructions, that we want to display to the 
# user so they know what to do

message = input("Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: ")
print(message)

print("''' Writing Clear Prompts '''")




print("\n")

''' Introducing while Loops '''

# while loop run as long as a certain condition is true.

print("''' Letting the User Choose When to Quit ''' ")
