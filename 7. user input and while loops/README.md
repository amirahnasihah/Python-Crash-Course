# Chapter 7

In this chapter learn how to accept user input so your program can then work with it. 
When your program needs a name, be able to prompt the user for a name. 
When your program needs a list of names, able to prompt the user for a series of 
names. To do this, use the input() function.

Also learn how to keep programs running as long as users want them to, 
so they can enter as much information as they need to; 
then, your program can work with that information. 
You’ll use Python’s while loop to keep programs running as long 
as certain conditions remain true.
