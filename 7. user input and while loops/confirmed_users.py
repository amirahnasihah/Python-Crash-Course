''' Using a while Loop with Lists and Dictionaries '''

# for loop is effective for looping through a list, but shouldnâ€™t modify a list inside a for loop because have trouble keeping track of the items in the list. 
# To modify a list, use a while loop. Using while loops with lists and dictionaries allows to collect, store, and organize lots of input to examine and report on later.

# and an empty list to hold confirmed users.

# Verify each user until there are no more unconfirmed users.
# Move each verified user into the list of confirmed users.
while unconfirmed_users:  #2 
    current_user = unconfirmed_users.pop()  #3
    
    print(f"Verifying user: {current_user.title()}")

    print(confirmed_user.title())
    
# at 1, start with unconfirmed_users list & empty list to hold confirmed_users.
# at 2, while loop run as long as list unconfirmed_users not empty.
# at 3, within this loop the pop() function removes unverified users one at a time from the end of unconfirmed_users.
# at 4, Candace is last in unconfirmed_users list, she the first to be removed, assigned to current_user & added to confirmed_users list. Next, brian then alice.
# when list unconfirmed_users empty, loop stops & list confirmed_users is printed.
