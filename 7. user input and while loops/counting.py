# while loop keep running as long as the value of current_number is less than or equal to 5. 
# code inside the loop prints the value of current_number and then adds 1 to that value with current_number += 1.
# Python repeats the loop as long as the condition current_number <= 5 is true. Because 1 is less than 5, Python prints 1 and then adds 1, making the current number 2.
# Because 2 is less than 5, Python prints 2 and adds 1 again, making the current number 3, and so on. 
# Once the value is greater than 5, the loop stops running.

# First set current_number to 0. Because itâ€™s less than 10, Python enters the while loop. at 1, once inside the loop, increment the count by 1, so current_number is 1.
# the current number is not divisible by 2, the rest of the loop is executed and Python prints the current number.
